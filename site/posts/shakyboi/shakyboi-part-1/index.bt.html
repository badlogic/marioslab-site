<h2>Shakyboi - Part 1: Of tree shaking and class files</h2>

<p>I don't hate <a href="https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard">ProGuard</a>. It's a fine piece of software. However, its documentation is a bit lacking, and some of its behaviour is weird. So what better way to spend a few weekends than to learn all the hard lessons Eric, creator of ProGuard, had learned over many years! Thus I've started building <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/shakyboi">Shakyboi</a>, my personal replacement for ProGuard. I'll probably reinvent everything ProGuard does badly. But at least I'll have some fun doing so.</p>


<h3>What's tree shaking?</h3>
<p>ProGuard takes as input Java <code>.class</code> files and "shrinks", optimizes, and obfuscates them. The "shrinking" part is more commonly known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaking"></a>tree shaking</a>, at least in the JavaScript space.</p>

<p>Tree shaking is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_code_elimination#:~:text=In%20compiler%20theory%2C%20dead%20code,not%20affect%20the%20program%20results.">dead code removal</a>. Removing dead code generally results in smaller binary sizes, a desirable thing for faster deployments, smaller and thus faster downloads, and potentially faster app start-up times.</p>

<p>In case of Java, we can apply tree shaking on multiple levels. For now, we'll concern ourselves with tree shaking at the class level. The goal of class level tree shaking is to remove any classes that are not used by the app.</p>

<p>Have a look at this contrived example Java app.</p>

<pre><code>// Zipp.java
public class Zipp {
    public void doZipp() {
        System.out.println("I'm a Zipp.");
    }
}</code></pre>

<pre><code>// Zapp.java
public class Zapp {
    public void doZapp() {
        System.out.println("I'm a Zapp.");
    }
}</code></pre>

<pre><code>// Zopp.java
public class Zopp {
    public void doZopp() {
        System.out.println("I'm a Zopp.");
    }
}</code></pre>

<pre><code>// Foo.java
public class Foo {
    public void doFoo() {
        System.out.println("I'm a Foo.");
        new Zipp().doZipp();
    }
}</code></pre>

<pre><code>// Bar.java
public class Bar {
    public void doBar() {
        System.out.println("I'm a Bar.");
        new Zapp().doZapp();
        new Zopp().doZopp();
    }
}</code></pre>

<pre><code>// App.java
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] argv) {
        new Bar().doBar();
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Let's assume we have compiled the 6 classes via <code>javac</code> and packaged them into a file called <code>app.jar</code> using the build system of our choice. The <code>app.jar</code> file (which is really just a ZIP file) would look like this.</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">App.class
Bar.class
Foo.class
Zapp.class
Zipp.class
Zopp.class
</code></pre>

<p>Running the app on the CLI looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">❯ java -jar app.jar
I'm a Bar.
I'm a Zapp.
I'm a Zopp.</code></pre>

<p>The command starts the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and tells it to look up the class <code>App</code> in the <code>app.jar</code> file and call its <code>main(String[])</code> method.</p>

<p>With our mushy brains, we can easily see from both the output and the source code that class <code>App</code> depends on class <code>Bar</code> (because <code>Bar</code> is referenced in <code>App.main(String[])</code>), and that <code>Bar</code> depends on <code>Zapp</code> (because <code>Zapp</code> is referenced in <code>Bar.doBar()</code>). Class <code>Foo</code> is not referenced in <code>App</code> or <code>Bar</code>, nor is <code>Zipp</code>. Congratulations, you just manually shook the class dependency tree (well, graph really), which looks like this:</p>

<div id="app-class-dependencies" style="height: 300px;"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
var nodes = new vis.DataSet([
    { id: 1, label: "App", color: "#FB7E81"},
    { id: 2, label: "Bar" },
    { id: 3, label: "Foo" },
    { id: 4, label: "Zipp" },
    { id: 5, label: "Zapp" },
    { id: 6, label: "Zopp" }
]);

var edges = new vis.DataSet([
    { from: 1, to: 2 },
    { from: 2, to: 5 },
    { from: 2, to: 6 },
    { from: 3, to: 4 },
]);

var container = document.getElementById("app-class-dependencies");
var data = {
    nodes: nodes,
    edges: edges
};
var options = {
    edges: {
        arrows: {
            to: {
                enabled: true
            }
        }
    }
};
var network = new vis.Network(container, data, options);
</script>

<p>In graph theory terms, we've created a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graph</a> that encodes the class dependencies, which has <a hreF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory)">2 connected components</a>. The connected component containing the <code>App</code> class contains all classes necessary for the successful execution of our app. All classes in the other connected components can be removed from our app.</p>

<p>Having performed our dependency analysis manually, we can remove the files <code>Foo.class</code> and <code>Zipp.class</code> from our <code>app.jar</code> file and the app will still work:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">❯ zip -d target/app.jar Foo.class Zipp.class
deleting: Zipp.class
deleting: Foo.class

❯ java -jar target/app.jar
I'm a Bar.
I'm a Zapp.
I'm a Zopp.</code></pre>

<p>Here's the before-and-after in terms of file size:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">❯ ls -lah app.jar
-rw-r--r--  1 badlogic  staff   4.1K Feb 20 14:16 app.jar

❯ zip -d target/app.jar Foo.class Zipp.class
deleting: Zipp.class
deleting: Foo.class

❯ ls -lah app.jar
-rw-r--r--  1 badlogic  staff   3.3K Feb 20 14:17 app.jar
</code></pre>

<p>We saved about 0.8K! 40 years ago that would have been marvelous.</p>

<h3>Constructing the class dependency graph from <code>.class</code> files</h3>
<p>Obviously, doing manual dependency analysis and removal of "dead" classes is an itsy bit too complex for real-world applications. Being the computer loving folks we are, we can surely devise a way to automate the class dependency graph creation.</p>

<p>For Java, we could do it in multiple different ways. One approach would be to parse Java source files, but that's just nasty, so we ignore that option.</p>

<p>A possibly less complex way to do it is by parsing <code>.class</code> files and extracting the classes a class depends on. For this, we have to understand the <a hre="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se15/html/jvms-4.html">Java class file format</a>. It's a mostly trivial and well thought out format, so it should be easy to parse and extract the information we need.</p>

<p>Instead of diving into the format specification, let's first have a look at the output of <code>javap</code> when fed one of our classes. <code>javap</code> comes with your JDK and is able to disassemble <code>.class</code> files. Here's what <code>Main.class</code> contains:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">❯ javap -c -v -cp app.jar App

<p>Looks intimidating at first sight, but it's not so bad! If you <code>CTRL + F</code> for <code>Bar</code>, you can see all the places <code>App</code> references <code>Bar</code> in the <code>.class</code> file.</p>

<p>We see a bunch of <code>Bar</code> in the constant pool section of the <code>javap</code> output. The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se15/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4">constant pool</a> is a lookup table referenced by other parts of the class. It contains symbolic references to other classes, fields, methods, constants and so on. Each constant pool entry has an index and a type. A constant pool entry may also reference another constant pool entry. We can see <code>Bar</code> in a handful of constant pool entries. Let's look at the first two.</p>

<pre><code>#7 = Class              #8             // Bar
#8 = Utf8               Bar
</code></pre>

<p>The entry at index 7 is of type <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se15/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1">Class</a>, and encodes, well, a class. It references another entry at index 8, which is of type <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se15/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7">Utf8</a>, a UTF-8 string encoding the class' name. Great! In general, we can assume that almost all classes a class depends on can be found in the constant pool in form of Class entries.</p>

<p>The actual byte code making up a class' method will reference the constant pool, e.g. the <code>App.main(String[])</code> method looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
descriptor: ([Ljava/lang/String;)V
flags: (0x0009) ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_STATIC
Code:
    stack=2, locals=1, args_size=1
        0: new           #7                  // class Bar
        3: dup
        4: invokespecial #9                  // Method Bar."":()V
        7: invokevirtual #10                 // Method Bar.doBar:()V
    10: return
    LineNumberTable:
    line 3: 0
    line 4: 10
    LocalVariableTable:
    Start  Length  Slot  Name   Signature
        0      11     0  argv   [Ljava/lang/String;
</code></pre>

<p>The instruction at byte code index 0 (<code>new #7</code>) references the constant pool entry at constant pool index 7, which is the Class entry discussed above. The instruction tells the JVM to construct a new instance of class <code>Bar</code>, as helpfully pointed out by <code>javap</code> via the comment <code>// class Bar</code> appended to the instruction.</p>

<p>Let's ignore the <code>dup</code> instruction.</p>

<p>The next instruction at byte code index 4 (<code>invokespecial #9</code>) calls a special method, the constructor of <code>Bar</code>. The constructor is specified as a constant pool entry at index 9. The constant pool entry is of type <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se15/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.2">MethodRef</a>, which encodes a class (<code>Bar</code> in this case), and the method of that class we want to invoke (the constructor of <code>Bar</code>):</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">#9 = Methodref          #7.#3          // Bar."<init>":()V</code></pre>

<p>The MethodRef references constant pool entries 7 and 3 (<code>javap</code> has again helpfully resolved them for us in the comment):</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">#3 = NameAndType        #5:#6          // "<init>":()V
#7 = Class              #8             // Bar</code></pre>

<p>Ah, we already know constant pool entry  7, it's the class! Constant pool entry 3 is of type <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se15/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.6">NameAndType</a>, which describes the name and type of either a field or a method. The type is encoded as a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se15/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3">descriptor</a> string. You may have seen those before, they may look a bit wonky. Here's the descriptor of <code>App.main(String[])</code></p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">([Ljava/lang/String;)V</code></pre>

<p>As it turns out, classes directly referenced by a class can all be found in the constant pool, either in form of a Class constant pool entry, or as a descriptor string. The latter is a bit more complex to handle, as we have to go through all constant pool entry types that reference such a descriptor. We can figure this out from the class file format specification. Additionally, we have to consider the super class hierarchy of the class, as well as the interfaces it implements, information that's also part of the <code>.class</code> file.</p>

<p>And if we can do it for one class, we can do it for all other classes it depends on, recursively, which gives us our class dependency graph. Easy!</p>

<h3>Up next</h3>
<p>I've already created a repository and filled in some class file parsing code, see <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/shakyboi">Shakyboi on GitHub</a>. In the next installment I'll discuss the implementation of the basic class level tree shaker.</p>
