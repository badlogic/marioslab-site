<p>I'd been saving up for a 486 DX 2 with 40Mhz, 8MB of RAM and a whopping 50MB HDD. As a dumb 11 year old on the country side, and without anything like the internet, I had no way of figuring out the cost of a PC. That my measly savings would only afford me a pocket calculator was not obvious to me. My parents saved up as well. In secret. Every week I'd ask mum if I'd saved enough. After two years of this Spiel, mum and dad solemnly announced "it is time!", strapped me into the car, and took me to the (now defunct) computer retailer in the big city. They let me put the money on the counter, and I completed my first big transaction at the big boy age of 12.</p>

<p>That was in 1995. Years later I realized that my parents had ponied up about 99.99% of the asking price. That explained our somewhat rustic, short, annual vaccation. It also shed some light on why dad was coming home late at times: he'd earn some extra cash fixing cars and doing construction work after his regular job. The damn machine cost my mum and dad almost a third of their annual income. I can't express in words how much this meant and will forever mean to me.</p>

<h2>Playful beginnings</h2>
<p>So there I was, machine plugged in, display and keyboard connected. What to do? Play games of course! Naturally, I couldn't afford to buy games retail. A relative of mine had connections to a super secret underground channel that'd copy floppies for the cost of a lollipop. I had a lot of floppies. With labels in terrible hand-writing, reading "Prince of Persia", "DOOM", "Dune II", or "Monkey Island".</p>

<p>Getting games to work in MS-DOS was often hard work (shout-out to my peeps growing up with 80ies computers. I know you had it rougher. No, I'm not getting off your lawn). <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> and <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> had to be infused with magic spells. Crashes, and more annoyingly,  unending hangs with super loud beeps were a daily occurance. The machine came with a manual for MS-DOS from which I could piece together the basics. My uncle would show me some tricks of the trade and provide me with aforementioned magic spells.</p>

<p>Within a year, I was able to afford a mouse and a double speed CD-ROM drive. Installing that CD-ROM drive was one of the most terrifying experiences in my life. The prospect of seeing this expensive machine go up in flames paralyzed me. And had I known of my parents' sacrifices, I'd have been even more scared to death. It took me a week to take the drive out of its anti-static wrapper. I'd touch the radiator, look at the drive, then put it back in. Eventually, my dad got fed up: "Son, if you don't put it in there, I'm going to put it in there. Do you want a car mechanic to handle your computer?". Under tears (not kidding), I got myself a screw driver and went to work. I'm happy to report that everything went better than expected. Otherwise, you might not be reading these lines.</p>

<p>Unconciously, I learned how to use a PC. Not because I wanted to become a programmer, but so I could play all those amazing games.</p>

<h2>Leveling up</h2>
<p>This first year of owning a PC opened up a seemingly infinite amount of new worlds to me. PC games were fantastic in their diversity and quality. And sometimes they even managed to convey a great story. You had jaw droppers like DOOM and Duke Nuke 'Em, that'd punch you right in the face, story be damned. You had zen-like experiences with Myst or Lost Eden. The absurd humor of Day of the Tentacle or Sam and Max would give you mad giggles. Privateer would let you explore the galaxy on your own terms, and Master of Orion had you burn it all down. Slowly but surely, two questions formed in my punny brain: How did they do this? <em>How can I do this?</em></p>

<p>Coincidentially, my school got their first PCs and (limited) internet access. There were quite a few sites dedicated to game programming, but everything was in English. Back then, that was to much of a barrier for me. I had to find the answers to my questions elsewhere. Small aside: this was the beginning of me switching from consuming German media to consuming mostly English media. Again, not because I had an interest in the language or using it abroad, but because it was the only path way to learning how to write my own games.</p>

<p>Serendipitously, as internet "searches" were back then, I ended up on a site archiving listings of games written in various BASIC dialects. The listings were collected and digitalized from computer magazines I could not buy in Austria. There wasn't much in the way of an explanation what it all meant, but it did include instructions on how to run the games. One such set of instructions explained that the game could be run with a program called QBasic that was included with MS-DOS 6.22. That's what I ran at home! I copied all listings for QBasic onto a floppy, waited for the school day to end, and finally arrived back home.</p>
