<p>When I decided to <a href="../hello-world/">throw everything away</a> and start from scratch, I was looking through available options for building a (mostly) static site. My requirements for the new site:</p>

<ul>
	<li>All of the content must be editable via any text editor.</li>
	<li>I must be able to freely choose the structure of the content.</li>
	<li>Must provide an expressive templating engine so I can stay in text files for the most part.</li>
	<li>Allow me to extend the functionality of the templating engine with code in a typed language.</li>
	<li>Don't force some theming format on me. I want to control all of the CSS and keep it minimal.</li>
	<li>Let me stuff everything in a Git repository.</li>
	<li>Bonus points if I can add a HTTP RPC web service for dynamic content such as comments, preferably in the same typed language with which I can extend the template engine.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a first step, I checked out the solutions my peers went with.
<a href="https://floooh.github.io/">Andre</a> is using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. <a href="https://samskivert.com/">Michael</a> used to use Jekyll for his site, but recently switch to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. I'll refrain from citing specific reasons. Suffice it to say that a lot of swearing and phrases like "bit rot" were involved.</p>

<p>I went to check out both Jekyll and Hugo. Jekyll is built on Ruby, uses <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> as its (capable) templating engine, and dictates a very <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/">rigid directory structure</a>. I'm not a big fan of Ruby (fight me), and while Jekyll let's you do a lot, I felt I'd probably be fighting it's rigidity. Jekyll's documentation was fantastic though!</p>

<p>Hugo comes off as a more enterprise-y version of Jekyll. That also expresses itself in its documentation. There's a lot of it, including videos. Why people think videos are a great source of documentation I'll never understand. Hugo is built on Go and uses Go's not very expressive, <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/">built-in templating engine</a>. Just based on the overwhelming documentation, Hugo seemed to complex to me, so I abandoned it as well.</p>
