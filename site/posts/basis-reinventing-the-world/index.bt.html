<p>When I decided to <a href="../hello-world/">throw everything away</a> and start from scratch, I was looking through available options for building a (mostly) static site. My requirements for the new site:</p>

<ul>
    <li>All of the content must be editable via any text editor.</li>
    <li>I must be able to freely choose the structure of the content.</li>
    <li>Must provide an expressive templating engine so I can stay in text files for the most part.</li>
    <li>Allow me to extend the functionality of the templating engine with code in a typed language.</li>
    <li>Don't force some theming format on me. I want to control all of the CSS and keep it minimal.</li>
    <li>Let me stuff everything in a Git repository.</li>
    <li>Bonus points if I can add a HTTP RPC web service for dynamic content such as comments, preferably in the same typed language with which I can extend the template engine.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a first step, I checked out the solutions my peers went with.
<a href="https://floooh.github.io/">Andre</a> is using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. <a href="https://samskivert.com/">Michael</a> used to use Jekyll for his site, but recently switch to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. I'll refrain from citing specific reasons. Suffice it to say that a lot of swearing and phrases like "bit rot" were involved.</p>

<p>I went to check out both Jekyll and Hugo. Jekyll is built on Ruby, uses <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> as its (capable) templating engine, and dictates a very <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/">rigid directory structure</a>. I'm not a big fan of Ruby (fight me), and while Jekyll let's you do a lot, I felt I'd probably be fighting it's rigidity. Jekyll's documentation was fantastic though!</p>

<p>Hugo comes off as a more enterprise-y version of Jekyll. That also expresses itself in its documentation. There's a lot of it, including videos. Why people think videos are a great source of documentation I'll never understand. Hugo is built on Go and uses Go's not very expressive, <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/">built-in templating engine</a>. Just based on the overwhelming documentation, Hugo seemed to complex to me, so I abandoned it as well.</p>

<p>At this point I decided not to look any futher, because ...</p>

<h2>How hard can it be?</h2>
<p>What do I need to build my own static site generator? It's going to be a command line application, so I need to parse command line arguments. A templating engine is needed to do more complex things like listing published blog posts. Finally, I need a driver that assembles all these pieces and packs it up in a command line app and marries it with a file system watcher. Bonus points for making that driver easy to embed in a web service that serves the static files and provides end points for dynamic content like comments.</p>

<p>I'm familar with the JVM. It's proven technology for web backends, and its tooling is pretty good. And while Kotlin or Scala would be fun to (re-)try in production, Java 8+ has enough creature comforts to make it painless enough.</p>

<p>With the JVM as the target platform, I could surely find existing OSS components, fumble them together and call it a day. But where is the fun in that? All of the pieces will be hand-crafted, artisan products of love, with zero external dependencies except for what the Java standard library provides.</p>

<p>I like re-usable components, so the three pieces each go into a separate project and build on top of each other. Since I prefer declarative builds, I'll be going with Maven as the build and dependency management system pulling everything together. I've used Gradle in anger, and its mix of Ant like free-form-ness and use of Groovy make me dislike it more than Maven. Also, it's still a pain to deploy to Maven Central.</p>

<p>Speaking of Maven Central: all components will be BSD licensed OSS. This forces me to keep everything somewhat clean and tested, with OK documentation. I wouldn't want a LinkedIn recruiter not spam call me because of a poor quality public repository.</p>

<p>All of these and future components need an umbrella. And thus <strong>Basis</strong> was born.</p>

<h2>Basis-arguments</h2>
<p>Robust command line parsing can be more involved than one might think. A single argument may have multiple forms, e.g. <code>-i</code> and <code>--input</code>, may be optional, and may expect a value of a specific type that needs validation and must be converted to a corresponding type of the programming language of choice.</p>

<p>But that's not all. You also want a way to generate nicely formatted help and error messages, so the user can explore the options your program offers, or figure out which parameter was incorrect or missing.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/basis-arguments">basis-arguments</a>, I tried to code up all these requirements, with a minimal API and in the most type-safe way Java allows me to do it. Here's what that looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="java">public static void main (String[] argv) {
    Arguments args = new Arguments();

    // Add a simple, optional argument that doesn't expect a value.
    Argument verbose = args.addArgument(
        new Argument("-v", "Display verbose log messages.", true)
    );

    // Add an argument that expects a string value.
    StringArgument serve = args.addArgument(
        new StringArgument(
            new String["-s", "--serve-static-files"],
            "Serve static files from the given directory, non-optional.",
            "<directory>",
            false
        )
    );

    // Add an argument that expects an integer value.
    IntegerArgument port = args.addArgument(
        new IntegerArgument(
            new String[] {"-p", "--port"},
            "The port to serve the files from, non-optional.",
            "&lt;port&gt;", false
        )
    );

    // And a final argument so the user can request to display
    // the nicely formatted help text.
    Argument help = args.addArgument(
        new Argument("-h", "--help", "Display this help text and exit.", true)
    );

    try {
        // Parse the arguments
        ParsedArguments parsed = args.parse(argv);

        // If the user requested to be shown the help text, use the
        // Arguments#printHelp function to output it nicely formated.
        if (parsed.has(help)) {
            args.printHelp(System.out);
            System.exit(0);
        }

        // Otherwise check if non-value arguments are given, and get the
        // non-optional port value.
        boolean isLogVerbosely = parsed.has(verbose);
        boolean isServeStaticFiles = parsed.has(serve);
        int portNumber = parsed.getValue(port);
    } catch (ArgumentException e) {
        // We got an unexpected argument, or a non-optional argument wasn't given,
        // or an argument value couldn't be parsed, so tell the user what they
        // did wrong, using the error message from the exception.
        System.err.println(e.getMessage());
        Sytem.exit(-1);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If this is not self-explanatory enough, I've failed my mission statement. I also hope you can excuse the wonky formatting. I use a 120 character wide line length, because I have a monitor that is made for humans, and not for ants (> 640x480). What can I say, works for me!</p>

<h2>Basis-template</h2>
<p>Template engines are a dime a dozen on pretty much all platforms. On the JVM, they range from <a href="https://github.com/samskivert/jmustache">not very expressive</a>, to full blown <a href="http://mitchellbosecke.com/pebble/home">scripting languages</a>. I'm in the "expressive" camp and think that if you are using a template engine at all, it might as well allow you to shoot yourself in the foot with a bazooka.</p>

<p>As I'm a bit of a compiler geek, and since it's been almost 2 years since I touched compiler code, I ignored everything that's already available, and wrote my own little templating engine called <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/basis-template">basis-template</a>.</p>

<p>There's a lot of functionality cramed into the little thing, so I recommend to read its <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/basis-template/blob/master/README.md">extensive documentation</a>. Here, we just want to get a taste of it, and highlight some interesting features and implementation details.</p>

<h3>What's in a template?</h3>
<p>Basis-template is inspired by <a href="http://jtwig.org/">Jtwig</a>, which itself is a sort of JVM port of PHP's <a href="https://twig.symfony.com/">Twig</a>. A template consists of text and code spans, the latter delimited by <code>\{\{</code> and <code>\}\}</code>. Anything found in a code span is interpreted by the templating engine according to the syntax and semantics of the template language.</p>

<pre><code class="html">Hello \{\{name\}\}.</code></pre>

<p>This simple template has 2 text spans (<code>"Hello "</code> and <code>.</code>) that will be output verbatim, and one code span (<code>\{\{name\}\}</code>) that will be evaluated to some value by the template engine. The value then replaces the code span in the final output.</p>

<p>The driver on the Java side looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="java">TemplateLoader loader = new FileTemplateLoader();
Template template = loader.load("helloworld.bt");
TemplateContext context = new TemplateContext();
context.set("name", "Hotzenplotz");
System.out.println(template.render(context));
</code></pre>

Yielding the output:

<pre><code class="html">Hello Hotzenplotz.</code></pre>

<p>Basis-template's language features almost everything the programmer heart desires:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Literals for booleans, numbers, characters, strings as well as maps and arrays.</li>
    <li>All sorts of unary, binary an ternary operators.</li>
    <li>Control flow statements like <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>continue</code>, <code>break</code>, or <code>return</code>.</li>
    <li>Assignments to block scoped variables.</li>
    <li>Access to fields and methods of injected Java objects and classes.</li>
    <li>Functions as first class citizens.</li>
    <li>Includes of various forms.</li>
    <li>Maros.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can not define your own data types in basis-template, though you can come close by using <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/basis-template#literals">map and array literals</a>.</p>

<p>The power of basis-template stems from the fact, that you can inject any JVM type into the template via the <code>TemplateContext</code>. Need <code>Math.cos()</code> in your code?</p>

<pre><code class="html">\{\{cos(3.14)\}\}</code></pre>

<pre><code class="java">context.set("cos", (DoubleFunction<Double>)Math::cos);
System.out.println(template.render(context));
</code></pre>

<pre><code>-0.9999987317275395</code></pre>

<p>The interpreter responsible for evaluating templates is also smart enough to ensure the proper types are used when interacting with JVM objects, and will even resolve overloaded methods and functions. Speaking of interpretation!</p>

<h3>Parsing, error reporting and interpretation</h3>
<p>A lot of template engines and other compiler-like projects rely on parser generators like <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a>. You usually provide a grammar in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">(extended) Backus-Naur form</a> flavor, fight against the peculiarities of an LR(k) or Peg parser, until the whole thing is not maintainable anymore, and error handling becomes a major pain.</p>

<p>Since I'm in full control of all aspects of the template language, I can also define its syntax in such a way, that hand-writing a <a>recursive descent LL(1) parser</a> is trivial. In fact, the <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/basis-template/blob/master/src/main/java/io/marioslab/basis/template/parsing/Parser.java">entire parser is less than 450 LOC</a>. While small, it supports syntax comparable in complexity to Lua and JavaScript.</p>

<p>The error reporting of many template engines is also more than lack luster, with some not even reporting the line where the error happened. While no error reporting is perfect, I think basis-templates error reporting is pretty OK given its scope:</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">Error (site/posts/hello-world/index.bt.html:12): Error in included file.
Error (site/posts/hello-world/../../_templates/post_header.bt.html:1): Error in included file.
Error (site/posts/hello-world/../../_templates/header.bt.html:31):
Couldn't find method 'omg' for object of type 'SiteFile'.

        Hey, look at this. {\{file.omg()}\}
                                  ^^^^^
</code></pre>

<p>Basis-template is essentially an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)#Abstract_syntax_tree_interpreters">abstract syntax tree interpreter</a>, an evaluation strategy that's commonly known to be slow, but easy to implement. Even some mature languages like Ruby have used AST interpretation for a long time, before switching to a byte code virtual machine.</p>

<p>How slow is slow? To answer this question, I forked <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/template-benchmark">template-benchmark</a>, a <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">JMH-based</a> micro-benchmark suite, that pits popular JVM template engines against each other. Results:</p>

<p>Basis-template is in second place, behind <a href="https://github.com/fizzed/rocker">Rocker</a>. The interesting part: Rocker compiles its templates to Java code, which then gets JIT compiled by the JVM. I think it's fair to say that at 55% of the speed of a JVM JIT compiled solution, basis-template is pretty fast.</p>

<p>I spent quite some time on optimizing basis-template. You can view my optimization steps in <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/basis-template/commits/master?after=2770422016a0c2cefa17292f19995d13da4b26a9+34">these commits</a>. The optimizations where driven by a healthy dose of <a href="https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html">JProfiler</a> and observing changes in the JMH benchmark.</p>

<p>The biggest speed up was achieved by moving from interpretation from <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/basis-template/blob/9a0be172ae216a1830b0766778872748358a6fd9/src/main/java/io/marioslab/basis/template/AstInterpreter.java">a set of big, static methods</a> that used <code>instanceof</code> to, <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/basis-template/commit/a9f17629f802548c4ff956e6d7f4bd751d2bfbc0#diff-ac5f79d86b3314790b8fcc3de9b26d14">plain old virtual dispatch</a>. Turns out its really hard beating the JVM at its own game.</p>

<p>The curious can find the entire interpreter code in the <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/basis-template/blob/master/src/main/java/io/marioslab/basis/template/parsing/Ast.java"><code>Ast</code> class</a>. It pains me to have that code intermingled with the type definitions, but that is the price to pay for good performance.</p>

<h2>Basis-site</h2>
<p>With the exciting part out of the way, it is time to speak about the boring part: <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/basis-site">basis-site</a>, the actual site generator.</p>

<p>Basis-site operates like this: you give it an input directory, it process each encountered file, and writes the result to an output directory. That's it.</p>

<p>The magic happens in the processing step. It is performed by a configurable list of processors. An input file is passed through this list of processor. Each processor can modify the file content and final output file name. The output of one processor is the input of the next processor in the list.</p>

<p>Out-of-the-box basis-site comes with a single processor that will evaluate every file containing the infix <code>.bt.</code> in its file name via basis-template, and strip the infix from the output file name. The processor will not touch files without the infix. These files will be copied verbatim (or processed by a user defined processor if that processor so desires).</p>

<p>The template file processor will also inject a handful of functions into each template for formating dates and listing other input files and their metadata, which is defined in a code span. This is similar to Jekyll's and Hugo's front matter, except that it's also defined in the template language.</p>

<p>The only other rule is that files and folders starting with <code>_</code> are not processed.</p>

<p>The most basic site with a landing page, about page and shared header and footer would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>input/
    _templates/
        header.html
        footer.html
    css/
        style.css
    js/
        code.js
    index.bt.html
    about.bt.hml
</code></pre>

<p>The directory structure is completely arbitrary. The files in the <code>_templates/</code> directory will be ignored (but are accessible to templated files, e.g. for inclusion). The folders <code>css/</code> and <code>js/</code> will be copied verbatim. The <code>index.bt.html</code> and <code>about.bt.html</code> file are evaluated via basis-template and stripped of their infix. They include the header and footer via the basis-template <code>include</code> statement.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- index.bt.html --&gt;
{\{include "_templates/header.html"}\}

&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my website&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about me on the &lt;a href="about.html"&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

{\{include "_templates/footer.html"}\}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;!-- about.bt.html --&gt;
{\{include "_templates/header.html"}\}

&lt;h1&gt;About me&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a little pea, I love the birds and the trees. Go back to the
&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;landing page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

{\{include "_templates/footer.html"}\}
</code></pre>

The output would look like this:

<pre><code class="html">output/
    css/
        style.css
    js/
        code.js
    index.html
    about.html
</code></pre>

<p>Basis-site can be used either as a command line application, or embedded in a JVM application. This very site uses the latter approach, so I can add additional processors for tasks like <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/marioslab-site/blob/master/src/main/java/io/marioslab/processors/ImageCropProcessor.java">image resizing and cropping</a>, or provide more functionality to templates. It also allows me to serve dynamic content like comments via a tiny web service based on the excellent <a href="https://javalin.io/">Javalin</a> (which I have no intention of re-inventing).</p>

<p>This only scratches the surface of this particular foot gun. Read the <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/basis-site/blob/master/README.md">documentation</a> and explore <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/marioslab-site">this site's source code</a> for a site in production.</p>

<h2>Moving on</h2>
<p>There are a handful of NIH projects still to be done. What's a blog without comments? What are comments without captcha? Also, I'd like to track some basic site visit stats without having to turn over all of our data to Google. All perfectly scoped little things for me to reinvent badly!</p>

<p>How many cool points do it get when I tell you that this site is managed by <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>? None? OK. <em>Sad trombone.</em></p>
