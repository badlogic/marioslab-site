<h2>Qak - Of characters, tokens, and streams</h2>

<p>
	Last time, I laid out <a href="https://marioslab.io/posts/qak/minimally-viable-product/">the plan for Qak 0.1</a>, the minimally viable product version of the language. Quite a bit of work has been completed already, and many adventures, especially related to performance improvements, have been made. Great material for another blargh post. Today we'll have a look at the first step of making sense of a Qak source file though. A bit boring, but it needs to be done.
</p>

<p>
	What's this magical first step? If you had any kind of formal computer science education then the terms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis">lexical analysis, lexing, scanning, or tokenization</a> might be familiar.
</p>

<p>
	In non-academic words: take a bunch of bytes, figure out which bytes make up a character, then group characters together into words that make up sentences (or statements in your code). Going forward, I shall refer to this process as <strong>tokenization</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	Funnily enough, a smart guy called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy">Chomsky's</a> came up with a bunch of sciency stuff to describe (formal) grammars of natural languages. And while initially promising, Chomsky's work failed to be applicable to natural languages, which led to many sad trombone sounds in the linguist community. At least that's what my linguist wife told me. I'm obliged by law to believe her.
</p>

<p>
	However, Chomsky's work was actually quite useful for us computer folks. Many of the techniques we use, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a>, or their recursive version, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parsers</a>, can be fitted Chomsky's formal grammars. It's also a fantastic way to torture university students in their first compiler engineering course.
</p>

<h2>Up next</h2>
<p>This should be enough to create a contrived factorial nano benchmark to compare Qak against the likes of Lua and Python. Next time we'll look at the implementation of the parser and generation of the abstract syntax tree for the poor excuse of a language specification outlined above.</p>
