<h2>Here we go again...</h2>

<p>
	It's been almost 2 years since I last wrote a blurb on this blargh. Welp, I need a new creative programming side project before I go insane. Let's call it <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/qak">Qak</a>!
</p>

<p>
	You might remember me waxing on and on about <a href="https://marioslab.io/posts/wee/dissecting-history/">Wee</a> a long time ago. That eventually ended up becoming <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/paperbots">Paperbots</a>, a browser-based programming environment geared towards beginners, teachers, as well as programmers who want a simple creative outlet. It worked out pretty well, and were I not as lazy as I am, I'd figure out how to get the certificate for the site going again, so you can enjoy the oevres my pupils created.
</p>

<p>
	Paperbots was written in TypeScript and intended for browser-use only. In recent months, I returned to native land, writing (probably terrible) C, C++ and some x86_64 assembly. <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a> made this so enjoyable, that I started graving working on a C++ based side project to get the creative juices flowing again. There's just something magical about not being tied to a managed runtime and peaking and poking at memory addresses.
</p>

<p>
	What better excuse to start yet another language/VM project! This time around, I don't have any lofty goals. Goals take the fun out of the equation. Instead, I'll just see where the wind carries me.
</p>

<p>
	While I'd love to create something similar to <a href="https://twitter.com/munificentbob?lang=en">Bob Nystrom's</a> excellent <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a>, I neither have the time, talent nor copy editor to come up with something as educationally sound. I do however hope to add on top of Bob's amazing work by building a statically typed scripting language instead of a dynamically typed one. It will be interesting to see how it performs compared to the likes of Python, Bob's <a href="https://github.com/wren-lang/wren">Wren</a>.
</p>

<p>
	While Bob did occasionally dive into the real-life issues that arrive when creating a programming language and runtime, I feel like more documentation of that sort of pain can provide additional knowledge on Bob's already impecable work. So, this is not me telling you about my successes. This is going to be me detailing my failures and dumbness!
