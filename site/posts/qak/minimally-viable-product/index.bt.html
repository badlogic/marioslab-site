<h2>Qak 0.1</h2>

<p>
	Alrighty. With all the basics out of the way as described in the <a href="https://marioslab.io/posts/qak/humble-beginnings/">last Qak post</a>, it's time to define a minimal language I want to implement. This v0.1 will only contain the absolute mininum language features needed to get the infrastructure composed of tokenizer, parser, AST, type checker, byte code generator, and interpreter going. Ideally, I can also build the debugger interface for this.
</p>

<p>
	Once all these components are in place for language version 0.1, I hope to be able to iterate quickly, adding new language, interpreter and standard library features. I've used this iterative approach for previous (toy) language projects and it's so far worked pretty well. It's also a surefire way to run into dead ends, which means I get to document my back tracking and failures.
</p>

<h2>v0.1 language features</h2>
<p>
	Before we dive into the semantics and syntax bike shed, let me quickly lay out the planned high level language features for v0.1.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Types: <code>boolean</code>, <code>int32</code>, <code>float32</code>.</li>
	<li>Functions and operators</li>
	<li>Function and operator overloading.</li>
	<li>Foreign function interface, so we can call into native code.</li>
	<li>Modules.</li>
	<li>Module <code>std</code>, containing <code>print()</code> and maybe a handful of other things.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's look at these in more detail.
</p>

<h3>Types</h3>
<p>
	Only supporting two primitive types in the beginning makes things significantly simpler. <code>boolean</code> is needed for conditionals. <code>int32</code> and <code>float32</code> are what you'd expect. Why not just <code>int32</code>? Because it complicates the type checker just an itsy bit more possibly.
</p>

<p>
	These types are built into the language and have no explicit definition in form of Qak source code. In later language versions, I'll try to keep the number of built-in types to a minimum. Types like the inevitable <code>string</code>, <code>list</code>, or <code>map</code> will hopefully be expressible by the built-in types.
</p>

<p>
	v0.1 of Qak will not allow user defined types. This means I also don't have to settle on the syntax for defining types yet. The compiler will just magically know about them, and pretend they are defined in module <code>std</code>. For the sake of discussion, just assume there's a file <code>std.qak</code>, which contains the standard library.
</p>

<pre><code>module std

type boolean
type int32
type float32
</code></pre>

<p>
	It will also not include any string or collection types, which keeps the scope small. The v0.1 types don't require me to implement a GC, which is nice, but also an open invitation to get into a dead end. We'll see how that works out.
</p>

<h3>Functions and operators</h3>
